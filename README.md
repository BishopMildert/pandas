# Python Data Analytics Portfolio

## A showcase of functions for data analysis using common python libraries for Data Analysis and some other cool data stuff.

The objective of this repo is to show the most common statistical/ programming functions one is
likely to use when dealing with large datasets and how I use them.

This work is based on the FreeCodeCamp Python Analytics certificate path, PyImageSearch and other resources.
